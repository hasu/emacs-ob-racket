An [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] feature that defines support for [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] Babel code blocks written in [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]].

Includes support for many of the usual Org =SRC= block header arguments (with the notable exception of =:session=), as well as some extras for controlling the way that code blocks are evaluated. The additional controls are perhaps more important for Racket than for most other languages, since Racket is not just one language. Rather, Racket is an open-ended, user-extensible collection of languages (including, e.g., Racket, Scribble, Slideshow, Redex, and Magnolisp), which may not always be evaluated in the Racket VM in the usual way of just invoking the =racket= executable.

* Pre-Requisites

To use =ob-racket=, first ensure that Org-Mode is installed in Emacs, as it probably is. For a richer editing experience you may also want to ensure that a major mode (such as [[https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode][racket-mode]]) has been configured for editing =racket= code blocks in Org.

If your mode for editing Racket code is not called =racket-mode=, you'll want to specify the mode to use with something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("racket" . geiser))
#+END_SRC

* Installation

Firstly, you may want to byte compile the "ob-racket.el" file, for example by invoking the =byte-compile-file= function under Emacs.

Then make sure the =ob-racket= feature is on Emacs' =load-path= so that it can be loaded on demand:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/my/path/to/emacs-ob-racket")
#+END_SRC

Furthermore, you should enable =racket= code for evaluation (e.g., upon invoking =org-babel-execute-src-block=, by default bound to =C-c C-c= under Org), by having the =org-babel-load-languages= variable include =racket=. Something like this should do the trick:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     (racket . t)
     ;;(scribble . t) ;; if Scribble support is available
     ))
#+END_SRC

Code evaluation may still require confirmation, depending on the value of the =org-confirm-babel-evaluate= variable, which is customizable, and may also be set file locally.

Some =ob-racket= functionality relies on a Racket module for converting Racket values to Emacs Lisp ones, and it can be worthwhile to byte-compile that module:
: raco make ob-racket-runtime.rkt

* Documentation

There is no separate documentation for =ob-racket=, so look at the [[./ob-racket.el][source code]], and the Emacs Lisp docstrings of the functions and variables appearing there. You will probably also find the [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Working-with-Source-Code][relevant Org documentation]] useful:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (progn
    (info-display-manual "org")
    (Info-goto-node "Working With Source Code"))
#+END_SRC
